
Causal structure learning by greedy equivalence search with generalized score functions (which is applicable to mixed continuous and discrete data, data with Gaussian or non-Gaussian distributions, linear or nonlinear causal mechanisms, and variables with multi-dimensionalities.)


>> function [Record] = GES(X,score_type,maxP,parameters)
% INPUT:
% X: Data with T*D dimensions
% score_type: the score function you want to use
%               score_type = 1: cross-validated likelihood
%               score_type = 2: marginal likelihood
% maxP: allowed maximum number of parents when searching the graph
% parameters: when using CV likelihood, 
%               parameters.kfold: k-fold cross validation
%               parameters.lambda: regularization parameter

% OUTPUT:
% Record.G: learned causal graph
% Record.update1: each update (Insert operator) in the forward step
% Record.update2: each update (Delete operator) in the backward step
% Record.G_step1: learned graph at each step in the forward step
% Record.G_step2: learned graph at each step in the backward step
% Record.score: the score of the learned graph
